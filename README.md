üí† Tailwindcss, a CSS framework, which works using utility classes, and what is that? Utility classes are classes made for Tailwind use when the developer wants, for example, to change some value, of a single HTML element or several, and in these classes, each one has predefined values ‚Äã‚Äãand properties, contained in a CSS class, but with a different name. <br><br>

üîç How it works, basically, to use the tailwind, go to: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli and follow the entire tutorial, but basically, you write a normal HTML, which can content javascript
inside, and the tailwind is a output.css file which contains all the utility classes. then with that file export access, you can use the utility classes, at the practice on the HTML, for each element, when you want define an specific class for that element to do all of the changes in the CSS, there you ill put all the utility classes for that situation. <br><br>

‚ö†Ô∏è I cant upload all the entire content, because, since the github plataform only accept a specific quantity of files, and what i can say is, when you go use npm for packages, only
the node modules folder has a lot of files, so sorry.
